Tic Tac Toe with a twist (Nought's and Crosses) 
# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe in Python. The game is currently designed with a basic grid and uses X and O markers, but we are looking to expand the game to incorporate a Nought's and Crosses theme, as well as more complex designs, such as tanks and army Bradley fight vehicles.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the command `python tic_tac_toe.py` to start the game.
4. Enter the row and column numbers (in the range 1-3) to place your mark on the board.
5. The game will continue until there is a winner or a tie.
